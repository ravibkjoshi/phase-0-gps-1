What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The biggest misunderstanding I had was with Merge conflicts. What constituted them and how they can be resolved. 


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git Branches and best practices for avoiding merge conflicts. Always inputting git status and git branch to make sure you are where you intend to be.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
In this instance they were one and the same. But I asked what constitutes a merge conflict and when to use a checkout a git branch and when to use the master.  


What still confuses you about Github?
The ettiquette and overall order in which merges are done in larger groups. I hope to explore this more as I do more and more projects in GitHub. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had an amazing learning experience in the process. I was able to realize how people work in groups when collaborating in Github and also working together to commit and merge changes as necessary.
